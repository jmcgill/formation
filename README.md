Want to begin using Terraform, but unsure how to import your existing AWS infrastructure?

Formation is an early stages (pre-alpha) project to simplify bulk import of resources into Terraform,
using the existing provider functionality to bootstrap the process, and designed to be easy to upstream
into Terraform.

# Design Document

See [DESIGNDOC.md](https://github.com/jmcgill/formation/blob/master/DESIGNDOC.md)

# Status

Still working on the core framework - so don't expect this to do anything yet!
