# Data Source: aws_nat_gateway

Provides details about a specific Nat Gateway.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "subnet_id" {}

data "aws_nat_gateway" "default" {
  subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.public.id}"
}
```

Usage with tags:

```hcl
data "aws_nat_gateway" "default" {
  subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.public.id}"

  tags {
    Name = "gw NAT"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available
Nat Gateways in the current region. The given filters must match exactly one
Nat Gateway whose data will be exported as attributes.

* `id` - (Optional) The id of the specific Nat Gateway to retrieve.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The id of subnet that the Nat Gateway resides in.
* `vpc_id` - (Optional) The id of the VPC that the Nat Gateway resides in.
* `state` - (Optional) The state of the NAT gateway (pending | failed | available | deleting | deleted ).
* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.
More complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,
which take the following arguments:
* `name` - (Required) The name of the field to filter by, as defined by
  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNatGateways.html).
* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.
  An Nat Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.

## Attributes Reference

All of the argument attributes except `filter` block are also exported as
result attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating
any fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for
the selected Nat Gateway.

`addresses` are also exported with the following attributes, when they are relevant:
Each attachement supports the following:

* `allocation_id` - The Id of the EIP allocated to the selected Nat Gateway.
* `network_interface_id` - The Id of the ENI allocated to the selected Nat Gateway.
* `private_ip` - The private Ip address of the selected Nat Gateway.
* `public_ip` - The public Ip (EIP) address of the selected Nat Gateway.
