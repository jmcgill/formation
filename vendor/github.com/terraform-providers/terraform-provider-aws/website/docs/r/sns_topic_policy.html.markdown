# aws_sns_topic_policy

Provides an SNS topic policy resource

~> **NOTE:** If a Principal is specified as just an AWS account ID rather than an ARN, AWS silently converts it to the ARN for the root user, causing future terraform plans to differ. To avoid this problem, just specify the full ARN, e.g. `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root`

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "test" {
  name = "my-topic-with-policy"
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_policy" "default" {
  arn = "${aws_sns_topic.test.arn}"

  policy = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.sns-topic-policy.json}"
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "sns-topic-policy" {
  policy_id = "__default_policy_ID"

  statement {
    actions = [
      "SNS:Subscribe",
      "SNS:SetTopicAttributes",
      "SNS:RemovePermission",
      "SNS:Receive",
      "SNS:Publish",
      "SNS:ListSubscriptionsByTopic",
      "SNS:GetTopicAttributes",
      "SNS:DeleteTopic",
      "SNS:AddPermission",
    ]

    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      variable = "AWS:SourceOwner"

      values = [
        "${var.account-id}",
      ]
    }

    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["*"]
    }

    resources = [
      "${aws_sns_topic.test.arn}",
    ]

    sid = "__default_statement_ID"
  }
```
