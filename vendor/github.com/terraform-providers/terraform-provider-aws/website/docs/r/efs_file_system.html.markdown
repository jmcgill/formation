# aws_efs_file_system

Provides an Elastic File System (EFS) resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "foo" {
  creation_token = "my-product"

  tags {
    Name = "MyProduct"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** The `reference_name` attribute has been deprecated and might
be removed in future releases, please use `creation_token` instead.

The following arguments are supported:

* `creation_token` - (Optional) A unique name (a maximum of 64 characters are allowed)
used as reference when creating the Elastic File System to ensure idempotent file
system creation. By default generated by Terraform. See [Elastic File System]
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/) user guide for more information.
* `reference_name` - **DEPRECATED** (Optional) A reference name used when creating the
`Creation Token` which Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent file system creation. By
default generated by Terraform.
* `performance_mode` - (Optional) The file system performance mode. Can be either
`"generalPurpose"` or `"maxIO"` (Default: `"generalPurpose"`).
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the file system.
* `encrypted` - (Optional) If true, the disk will be encrypted.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The ARN for the KMS encryption key. When specifying kms_key_id, encrypted needs to be set to true.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID that identifies the file system (e.g. fs-ccfc0d65).
* `kms_key_id` - The ARN for the KMS encryption key.
* `dns_name` - The DNS name for the filesystem per [documented convention](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html).

## Import

The EFS file systems can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
