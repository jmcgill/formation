# aws_mq_broker

Provides an MQ Broker Resource. This resources also manages users for the broker.

For more information on Amazon MQ, see [Amazon MQ documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html).

Changes to an MQ Broker can occur when you change a
parameter, such as `configuration` or `user`, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
`apply_immediately` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a
brief downtime as the broker reboots.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_mq_broker" "example" {
  broker_name = "example"
  configuration {
    id = "${aws_mq_configuration.test.id}"
    revision = "${aws_mq_configuration.test.latest_revision}"
  }
  engine_type = "ActiveMQ"
  engine_version = "5.15.0"
  host_instance_type = "mq.t2.micro"
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.test.id}"]
  user {
    username = "ExampleUser"
    password = "MindTheGap"
  }
}
```
